# Day 2 - Show Me the Content

Besides printing literals such as 

	print 'lol'	# lol
	print 3.14	# 3.14
	
`print` also shows the content of a variable

	num = 10
	print num	# 10
	str = 'This is a duck.'
	print str	# This is a duck
	
You may also want to show the name of the variable along with its value by using formatted print

	num = 10
	print 'num = %d' % num	# num = 10
	
## Homework

Finish editing `printf.py`. (Hint: You may need to find out more about 'format specifier'.)
