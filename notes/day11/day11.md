# Day 11 - Laugh While You Can

In most cases a for loop can do just the same as what a while loop can do. For instance

    for i in range(0, 10):
        print i

is equivalent to
    
    i = 0
    while i < 10:
        print i
        i += 1

But in some circumstances while loop is the only option.
